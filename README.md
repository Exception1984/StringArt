      abstract =   "In this paper we propose a novel method for the automatic
                   computation and digital fabrication of artistic string
                   images. String art is a technique used by artists for the
                   creation of abstracted images which are composed of straight
                   lines of strings ten- sioned between pins distributed on a
                   frame. Together the strings fuse to a perceptible image.
                   Traditionally, artists craft such images manually in a
                   highly sophisticated and tedious design process. To achieve
                   this goal fully automatically we propose a computational
                   setup driven by a discrete optimization algorithm which
                   takes an ordinary picture as input and converts it into a
                   connected graph of strings that tries to reassemble the
                   input image best possibly. Furthermore, we propose a
                   hardware setup for automatic digital fabrication of these
                   images using an industrial robot that spans the strings.
                   Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach by
                   generating and fabricating a set of real string art images.",
